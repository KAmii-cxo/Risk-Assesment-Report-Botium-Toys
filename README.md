## **Current Assets Overview**

  - On-premises equipment for in-office business needs.
  - Employee equipment: desktops, laptops, smartphones, remote workstations, peripherals (headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations), surveillance cameras, etc.
  - Retail products available for sale, stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse.

## **Risk Assessment**

### **Risk Description:**
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards.

### **Control Best Practices:**
- The first of the five functions of the [NIST CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is Identify. Botium Toys needs to dedicate resources to identify assets and manage them appropriately.
- They will need to classify existing assets and assess the potential impact of asset loss, particularly critical systems, on business continuity.

### **Risk Score:**
- On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is **8**, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

---

## **Additional Comments:**
- **Potential Impact from Asset Loss:** Medium
  - The IT department lacks clarity on which assets could be at risk.
  
- **Risk to Assets or Fines from Governing Bodies:** High
  - Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations for keeping critical data private and secure.

---

## **Specific Findings:**

- **Access to Data:**
  - All employees currently have access to internal data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers' PII/SPII.
  
- **Encryption:**
  - No encryption is in use for the confidentiality of customers' credit card information stored and processed in the internal database.

- **Access Controls:**
  - Least privilege and separation of duties access controls have not been implemented.

- **IT Department Controls:**
  - The IT department has ensured the availability and data integrity of systems.
  - A firewall is in place that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
  - Antivirus software is installed and regularly monitored by the IT department.
  
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
  - The IT department has not installed an IDS.

- **Disaster Recovery:**
  - No disaster recovery plans or data backups are in place for critical data.

- **Breach Notification:**
  - A breach notification plan is in place for E.U. customers, with notification within 72 hours.
  - Privacy policies, procedures, and processes have been developed and enforced for data documentation and maintenance.

- **Password Policy:**
  - The password policy exists but is not in line with current minimum complexity requirements (e.g., at least eight characters, a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters).
  - There is no centralized password management system to enforce the policy, leading to occasional productivity issues when employees/vendors need password resets.

- **Legacy System Maintenance:**
  - Legacy systems are monitored, but there is no defined schedule or intervention methods.

- **Physical Security:**
  - The physical location of the company's main office, storefront, and warehouse has sufficient locks, up-to-date CCTV surveillance, and functional fire detection and prevention systems.

## **Conclusion:**

Botium Toys faces considerable risks due to the lack of appropriate security controls and non-adherence to privacy regulations. By implementing the necessary controls and following the compliance best practices outlined above, Botium Toys can improve its security posture and reduce risks associated with data loss, breaches, and regulatory fines.
